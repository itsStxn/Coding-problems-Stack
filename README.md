# Stack

## Difficulties

### Easy
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Valid Parentheses

### Medium
- Car Fleet
- Daily Temperatures
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- Generate Parentheses
- Min Stack

### Hard
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram

## Patterns
- Requires **LIFO (last in, first out)** behavior
- Use of **push / pop / peek**
- Needs to track **previous elements**
- Problem involves **matching pairs** (parentheses, brackets)
- Problem involves **valid or balanced structure**
- Requires **undo or backtracking logic**
- Processing elements **in order, but resolving later**
- Elements removed when **condition is met**
- Use of **monotonic stack** (increasing or decreasing)
- Asked to find **next greater / smaller element**
- Asked to remove **invalid or redundant elements**
- Requires tracking **indexes, not just values**
- Uses stack to **simulate recursion**
- Uses stack to **evaluate expressions**
- Requires **processing from left to right**
- Requires **processing from right to left**
- Uses stack to **delay decisions**
- Stack stores **partial results**
- Pop until **stack becomes valid**
- Handles **nested structures**
- Uses stack for **collision or elimination problems**
- Requires careful handling of **empty stack**
- Time complexity usually **O(n)** due to single pass
- Often paired with **arrays or strings**
- Stack size relates to **depth or nesting**
- Clear pattern of **push, check, pop**
- Final answer depends on **remaining stack state**
